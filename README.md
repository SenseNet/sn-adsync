# Active Directory synchronization for sensenet
Synchronization between Active Directory and the Content Repository for the [sensenet](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet) platform. It handles users, groups, organizational units and memberships too.

You may install this component even if you only have the **sensenet Services** main component installed. That way you'll get the backend part of the ad sync feature.

If you also have the [sensenet WebPages](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-webpages) component installed (which gives you a UI framework built on the ASP.NET WebForms technology), you'll also get UI elements for managing the sync process.

> To find out which packages you need to install, take a look at the available [sensenet components](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/sensenet-components).
